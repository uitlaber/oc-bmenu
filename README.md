# Backend menu in frontend

This plugin adds an option “Show backend menu when viewing site” to your frontend pages.

Also, you can hide the backend menu in settings page.

This solution may be good for content managers but not for frontend developers because admin menu may change the design of some themes.

## Usage

1. Install from OctoberCMS marketplace or with git: git clone https://github.com/uitlaber/oc-bmenu.git project/plugins/uit/bmenu

2. In the backend go to the “Settings > CMS > Backend menu in frontend” page and click on the “Show menu in frontend” option.
